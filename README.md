# 🚀 mYRC-with-JavaFX

## 📝 About the Project  
After using a traditional **chat server** in the terminal, I wanted to bring it to life by adding a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. Initially, I experimented with **Java Swing**, but I ultimately chose **JavaFX** due to its:  
- 🎨 **Enhanced graphics** and modern UI capabilities  
- ⚡ **Better performance** compared to Swing  
- 🆓 **Open-source flexibility**  
- 🔧 **Room for future improvements**  

With JavaFX, I can create a **dynamic, sleek, and modern chat experience**, setting the foundation for further enhancements!

## 🔧 Features  
✅ Real-time chat communication  
✅ Sleek and modern UI with JavaFX  
✅ Scalable for future improvements
